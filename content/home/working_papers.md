### Testability of Reverse Causality Without Exogeneous Variation
*with [Christoph Breunig](https://christophbreunig.wordpress.com/)*, submitted to [The Econometrics Journal](https://academic.oup.com/ectj)

*Abstract:* This paper shows that testability of reverse causality is possible even in the absence of exogenous variation, such as in the form of instrumental variables. Instead of relying on exogenous variation, we achieve testability by imposing relatively weak model restrictions and exploiting that a dependence of residual and purported cause is informative about the causal direction. Our main assumption is that the true functional relationship is nonlinear and that error terms are additively separable. We extend previous results by incorporating control variables and allowing heteroskedastic errors. We build on reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) embeddings of probability distributions to test conditional independence and demonstrate the efficacy in detecting the causal direction in both Monte Carlo simulations and an application to German survey data.

### The German Minimum Wage and Wage Growth: Heterogeneous Treatment Effects Using Causal Forests
*with [Carsten Schr√∂der](https://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.439337.de/personen/schroeder__carsten.html)*

*Abstract:* Previous research suggests that minimum wages induce heterogeneous treatment effects on wages across different groups of employees. This research usually defines groups ex ante. We analyze to what extent effect heterogeneities can be discerned in a data-driven manner by adapting the generalized random forest implementation of Athey et al (2019) in a difference-in-differences setting. Such a data-driven methodology allows detecting the potentially spurious nature of heterogeneities found in subgroups chosen ex-ante. The 2015 introduction of a minimum wage in Germany is the institutional background, with data of the Socio-economic Panel serving as our empirical basis. Our analysis not only reveals considerable treatment heterogeneities, it also shows that previously documented effect heterogeneities can be explained by interactions of other covariates.
