### Causal Feature Learning to learn macro-economic variables

Finding proximate causes of economic growth potential using complex economic trade relationships by using [Causal Feature Learning](https://github.com/eberharf/cfl) (empirical basis: yearly bilateral trade data for 180 countries, 7000 product categories, 50 years). Joint with Frederick Eberhardt (Caltech)

### Deconfounding using the Information Bottleneck principle

Developing methods to disentangle causal from spurious factors of variation in observational data by leveraging machine learning tools (artificial neural networks and the information bottleneck principle) and known markers of confounding in observational data.

### Novel Formalizations of the Principle of Independent Mechanisms

Developing a novel, formal interpretation of the [Principle of Independent Mechanisms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262037310/elements-of-causal-inference/) (causal, unlike spurious, relations are modular) to measure confounding in observational data, with Michel Besserve (Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems)
