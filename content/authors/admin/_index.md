My research interests lie at the intersection of causality and machine learning, with applications in neuroscience. In my doctoral dissertation I explore synergies between research on causality in machine learning and economics. In spring 2020, I visited [Frederick Eberhardt](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~fehardt/) at the California Institute of Technology  --- I will be joining his group as a post-doctoral scholar in 2021.
