I'm a Swartz Foundation Fellow for Theory in Neuroscience working on causality with [Frederick Eberhardt](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~fehardt/). I'm interested in how to address confounding in observational data and how to aggregate causal variables. Though the methods we develop are domain-general, I focus on neuroscientific applications. In my doctoral dissertation I explore synergies between research on causality in machine learning and economics. You can reach me at pburauel [at] caltech [dot] edu.
